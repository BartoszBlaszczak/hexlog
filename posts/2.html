<p>A few years ago, when I was just starting my adventure with serious
    programming in the Java world, I learned the basics of its largest and
    most important framework - Spring. I read Spring in Action, signed up
    for a course, and - like every novice (and not only) user - made Google
    and StackOverflow searches red. Spring itself is very extensive so
    after learning the basics (bean container) I got to know its other
    components - SpringMVC, SpringSecurity, SpringData, etc. I remember how
    I spent my nights getting to know Spring's secret knowledge and
    implementing it in quick exercises. It was not only a pleasure but also
    a requirement of the job market - in Java's backend world Java Spring
    is almost everywhere.<br/>
</p>

<p>As you know, Spring was created as a light, pleasant alternative to
    EJB (or the whole JEE) which at that time was such a monster that
    people welcomed Spring with relief and open arms. Although JEE was a
    semi-official standard I can count projects I have heard about that
    used it on one hand (at least on the Polish IT market). Albeit JEE has
    become as convenient as Spring over time - my engineering thesis'
    <a href="https://github.com/BartoszBlaszczak/Mercury">project</a>
    is an example - Spring rules programmers' minds. Have you heard
    about other serious and well-known Java backend IoC solutions?</p>

<p>A few years ago it seemed to me that Spring is a great framework,
    without which we are actually bound to use <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">JEE</span> Jakarta or some
    other niche solutions - how else make a serious application in Java?
    How to make serious DI? No kidding - you can't do it without Spring…
    Right?</p>

<p>Hey - did I just write that one of the most popular programming
    languages in the world is practically dependent? Why does it require
    something more? And I do not mean additional libraries that provide
    specific additional functions but the core of the application, the
    frame-work itself. Why can't we programming without Spring? Shouldn't a
    programming language and its standard library be sufficient scaffolds
    for an application? I guess so! So why it isn't'?</p>

<p>This question has bothered me for several years, along with the
    growing irritation for using Spring. I felt more and more clearly that
    something was wrong with both this framework and the whole approach to
    backend application architecture. The longer I programmed, the more I
    became convinced with it. But what exactly do I not like?</p>

<p>Well, exactly I do not like:<br/>
</p>

<ul>
    
    <li>binding beans too loosely</li>
    <li>overcomplication</li>
    <li>low efficiency</li>
    <li>magic approach - instead of engineering</li>
    <li>departure from UNIX philosophy</li>
</ul>

<h2>Binding beans too loosely</h2>

<p>This is a trait not only of Spring or Jakarta, but actually of the
    paradigm of these solutions. A few years ago I noticed out that from
    the programmer's point of view such a program looks like a set of
    unlinked elements. Do you notice it too? There is a bean and another
    one by it. A whole lot of beans. One bean refer to another - or more
    precisely to a dependency with another bean's type. Although the class
    of the second bean is right next to it, the programmer don't see its
    injection. He don't connect it, but the framework, and thus application
    without this framework is a set of unlinked beans - like a demo. I have
    to believe that it will be well combined. I cannot see this connection
    during writing and I am not really sure that a bean will actually be
    injected. Many times it turned out that it was not - it was enough that
    I forgot to add an annotation or make a JavaConfig. It is true that a
    good IDE suggests that something is missing - the problem is that
    prompting often do not work well. The norm is that the IDE highlights
    the fields in the class in red to indicate that it does not see this
    dependencies as Spring's beans - and is almost always wrong because it
    works. Almost - I can never be sure and injecting the collection I am
    left with pure faith that it will works.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The biggest problem, however, is with the Spring's own beans. Which
    configuration and which settings are actually loaded? I am never 100%
    sure what is going on and what these dozens of propertises are actually
    for. Can I remove any of them? Will something not work then? I need to
    check. Or maybe it's better not to touch it to be sure? Eh... <br/>
</p>

<p>And have you noticed how testing such a code looks like in practice?
    To test such a class, I have to feed it with dependencies. In the case
    of a unit test, it often ends in a total mockosis. After all, It's
    insane to manually create the entire dependency tree for one test,
    right? Mocks will allow me to test a given class by checking exactly
    how it used its dependencies and how it reacted to various data from
    them - and that's good - but on the other hand, such a tests will be
    out of touch with reality. Test cases may have little to do with what
    this class actually does. Even if I want to mock some dependencies, I
    usually mock most or all of them. The solution to this problem is a
    test with the application context. The problem is that such tests are
    run quite rarely. Why? Because they're slow. And they are slow because
    providing context takes a long time. But more on that later.<br/>
</p>

<p>Of course, I do not mean the criticism of inversion of control (IoC)
    - what is in my opinion absolutely right - but about this particular
    solution. The beans should get their dependencies from the outside.
    However, I dream of a DI that will not hide it under such a large veil
    of uncertainty. One where I can easily see it and verify it because it
    won't be hidden deep in the Behemoth's bowels. In other words - simple,
    readable, easily and quickly verifiable, obvious, statically typed and
    validated during compilation.<br/>
</p>

<p>And does DI need to be provided by an additional framework? In my
    opinion, this is such an important, inherent and fundamental issue that
    it shouldn't be like that!<br/>
</p>

<h2>Overcomplication</h2>

<p>Have you ever looked into Spring's insides? Without fear of my
    savings, I may buy a beer to each of my friends who know them well. But
    should we get to know them? Shouldn't it just be working? In my opinion
    it should! So why so many times in job interviews have I heard
    questions about the implementation details of this Behemoth? Well,
    because the longer you use it, the more you know that it is not that
    easy.<br/>
</p>

<p>Spring is very complicated and as it is the core of many&nbsp;
    applications, it transfers this complexity into them. For simple
    applications it is not so visible, but remember the software resembles
    a garden and grows very easily. Almost every spring application that I
    worked on, I saw some tricks, oversized configurations and non-standard
    approaches. Probably the most twisted solutions are in SpringSecurity -
    the element that should be the most obvious and trustworthy. And in the
    days before SpringBoot (not so old after all) it was even worse. Let's
    add deep reflection and breaking the code with it to get spaghetti
    after which you can get severe indigestion.<br/>
</p>

<p>Or maybe you know something like this:<br/>
</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 75%;" alt="Przykładowy stos wywołań Springa"
                                      src="pics/1_spring_stack_trace.png"/><br/>
</div>

<p>This is a snapshot of the stack in the controller of a <a href="https://github.com/BartoszBlaszczak/PaymentStore"
                                                             >very
    simple
    application</a>. And yes - this is truncated as you can see from the
    scroll
    bar. Don't You think there is too much of it? If it only concerned
    server calls, but I always see something like this when I watch the
    communication of beans. I can see it in the exception logs. I can see
    it everywhere. Is it normal?<br/>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Keep It Simple,
    Stupid!</p>

<h2>Low efficiency</h2>

<p>There is also a problem of poor performance. The application from
    the example above is extremely simple. Actually, it is a demo written
    for the recruitment process for a certain company (and yes - they hired
    me :)). It is written in the pretty fresh SpringBoot and it rises on my
    laptop (i7-7700HQ) for about 2 seconds. Not bad, but such an
    application should get up few times faster. Real business applications
    on Spring sometimes get up so long that you can even make a cup of tea
    in the meantime. Do we live in the seventies to be so?</p>

<p>Another problem - about which I wrote above - is that integration
    tests take so long that I know people who do not release them during
    implementation. Who would want to waste so much time? :) And at the end
    it turns out that half of the new feature needs to be rewrited.</p>

<p>It is also worth to realize how absurd runing a Spring application
    looks like. Before SpringBoot, it looked like this: the Spring
    application is deployed on a servlet container where, with help of
    deployment descriptor (do you remember such a thing?), The Spring's
    DispatcherServlet is launched (yes, yes - a remnant of JEE), which
    raises the context of the application and starts listening. On
    SpringBoot it is even more interesting because instead of deploying it
    on an external container, the application runs its own build-in
    container. How many absurdly unnecessary layers!</p>

<p>In addition to the developer's convenience argument, there is one
    more that we will think about when we pay for hosting :)<br/>
</p>

<h2>Magic approach - instead of engineering</h2>

<p>Do you hear about magic in programming? Something happens
    automagically - it means somehow and we don't know how. It once
    impressed me and I wanted to become a magican myself. However, I
    changed my mind after the myriads of lines of code written. Magic is
    cool when it works, but when something stops working I want to burn
    such magicans at the stake. I don't mean, of course, using
    abstractions, libraries or delegate responsibility. These are the
    things that engineers should use. However, Spring and similar tools do
    it wrong. Declarative programming combined with breaking the code with
    deep reflection and a spring mess, where I am never sure if something
    will work, makes that instead of programming with pleasure and focusing
    on business logic, I feel like an engineer meeting a shaman - I don't
    know if I should look at him with admiration or embarrassment (although
    with time I look with embarrassment more and more often). I'm just
    waiting for applications that will be written only as spring yaml
    configurations.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Do you pine for the days when
    programmers were programmers and wrote their own applications?</p>

<h2>Departure from UNIX philosophy</h2>

<p>Finally, one more reflection. Do you still remember the UNIX
    philosophy? I know that it is often not used anymore, that there is a
    lot of good software that is definitely not small and single-purpose
    and that, as everything in life, you need to find a convenient
    solution. Spring's philosophy, however, is an inflection. More than a
    breeze of spring, it already resembles a hailstorm. "Since we already
    have Spring, let's use SpringXxx - we get it almost for free and it's
    probably cool, right?" Doesn't it remind you of something?</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">One ring to rule
    them all,<br/>
    one ring to find them,<br/>
    One ring to bring them all<br/>
    and in the darkness bind them.</p>

<h2>What alternative?</h2>

<p>A few years ago, I started to wonder how you can get around these
    problems. I was looking for a sensible alternative that would not
    duplicate these drawbacks and at the same time give the convenience of
    creating efficient, scalable, testable and expandable applications. I
    remember three years ago when I was at <a href="https://confitura.pl">Confitura</a> conference, I
    saw <a href="https://youtu.be/u9fPhXjfv2E">this
        talk</a> about alternatives to Spring. I also remember that it made a
    very
    poor impression on me - instead of showing some interesting and
    sensible alternatives, it confirmed my belief that such alternatives
    practically do not exist. However, a few months later I saw Jarosław
    Ratajski's <a href="https://youtu.be/IURFpwtOYqU">speech</a>
    which perfectly fit my thoughts and confirmed my
    belief that the language itself has everything I need. Unfortunately, I
    did not find any specific proposals in this speech, so I tried to write
    a very simple DI framework based on a mirocontainer by myself. It
    solved many of the problems discussed above, but it was still not a
    perfect solution, so I started to wonder how to make a good DI without
    any framework. I made a few assumptions. It should be:<br/>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>simple</li>
    <li>convenient</li>
    <li>reliable</li>
    <li>testable</li>
    <li>scalable</li>
    <li>efficient</li>
    <li>trustworthy</li>
    <li>statically typed</li>
    <li>obvious and without magic</li>
</ul>

<p>About a year and a half ago, I had an idea how to do this. The
    arrival of the coronavirus plague in 2020 and the related restrictions
    have given me the time and impetus to try to write some application
    based on this idea.</p>

<p>At that time, I also met and fell in love with a new language -
    Kotlina. It is what I need from the language and what Scala should have
    been from the beginning and never became. Since then, I have been
    writing privately on JVM only in Kotlin - and trying my hand at Kotlin
    outside of JVM. This language and its entire ecosystem bring many
    interesting solutions. It also makes something that would be breakneck
    and uncomfortable in Java, as comfortable, elegant and simple. It
    allows me to focus on the merits instead of heroically struggling with
    things I shouldn't be doing at all. The aforementioned idea for a
    solution is based on Kotlin and thanks to this language it is possible
    to meet the assumptions of simplicity and convenience.</p>

<p>The solution I came up with is trivial, but it seems to meet the
    above assumptions. It is based on Kotlin's <span style="font-style: italic;">objects</span> and a specific design
    pattern that can be called Lazy Properties Application Context.</p>

<h3>Singletons</h3>

<p>You probably know the Singleton design pattern - all programmers
    learn it and hardly anyone uses it. This does not mean, however, that
    we do not need classes with only one instance, but we get it from the
    framework that takes care of their creation. For several years I have
    felt that something is wrong here. These instances are often impossible
    to create without deep reflection, or they are just plain constructor
    classes. In the first case, we become even more dependent on the
    framework, and in the second, we completely deviate from the Singleton
    pattern. The ideal solution would be if the language itself supports
    this pattern and as it turns out, this is exactly what the Kotlin's
    objects are. I decided to use them as the basis for the application
    beans.<span style="font-style: italic;"><br/>
</span></p>

<h3>Context</h3>

<p>However, we do not always want to refer to a given bean directly,
    but we need to hide it behind an interface. In the architecture of
    ports and adapters, the domain should not know the specific
    implementation of the adapter at all. This is where the application
    context comes in handy. However, the container-based context is what I
    just wanted to avoid, so the solution came to my mind - I just need a
    contextual class where beans will be its fields (in the Kotlin world it
    is called properties). Singletons can get their dependencies from such
    a source instead of the constructor. An almost trivial solution. To
    avoid problems with loading the beans and their sequence, I made them
    lazy. To that I added a very simple profile implementation and that's
    it! But talk is cheap. The code looks like this:</p>

<p>Here's what loading beans from context looks like:</p>

<p>
</p>

<pre style="background-color: rgb(43, 43, 43); color: rgb(169, 183, 198); font-family: 'JetBrains Mono',monospace;"><span
        style="color: rgb(204, 120, 50);">object </span>Controller <span
        style="color: rgb(255, 254, 0);">{<br/></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 254, 0);">   </span><span
        style="color: rgb(204, 120, 50);">private val </span><span style="color: rgb(152, 118, 170);">repository </span><span
        style="color: rgb(204, 120, 50);">by </span><span style="color: rgb(152, 118, 170); font-style: italic;">appContext</span>.<span
        style="color: rgb(152, 118, 170);">postsRepository</span></pre>

<p>And it is validated on compilation time (of course, the IDE easily
    prompts everything) and statically typed. It is also subject to the
    Kotlin's null safety.<br/>
    I was also wondering if all beans should be in context, but I found
    that I will only give there those that really depend on the runtime
    context, are adapters (in the architecture of ports and adapters) and
    those that I would like to mock in tests. Everything else can be
    directly invoked regular objects.</p>

<p>This solution gives inversion of control without the use of a
    container. And what about the functionalities that Spring gives us?
    Here I stated that we should apply the UNIX principle. There are a lot
    of solutions on the market for every need and I will deal with their
    analysis and comparison on this blog.<br/>
</p>

<h2>Does it even work?</h2>

<p>Exactly. I was curious how such a solution would fall into practice,
    so I decided to combine it with my plan to create this blog and wrote
    it as an application based on this idea. It turned out that it works
    without any problems and meets all the assumptions in my opinion. It
    starts up in no time and works flawlessly. As a server I used <a href="https://ktor.io/">Ktor</a> -
    the most popular server in the Kotlin world. I had some concerns about
    it - it is actually a framework. Fortunately, it is limited to serving
    and does not affect the overall application; it's well customizable and
    has great documentation. <br/>
</p>
<p>Everything is published on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/BartoszBlaszczak/hexlog">here</a>.
    This
    application is very simple and will grow with this blog, which will
    become the best test for it. <br/>
