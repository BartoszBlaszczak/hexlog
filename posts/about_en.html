<h1 align="center">Welcome to Hex.log!</h1>

<p><br />
<br />
</p>

<p align="left">It is a blog about programming from a wider
perspective, presenting and comparing approaches and paradigms and
helping to consciously choose the tools and architecture for
programming.</p>

<p>There will be no step-by-step tutorials showing how to use a
library, tool or framework. There are many such websites and the form
of the blog is not the best for that. If you are looking for something
like this, I recommend these websites:</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/" target="_blank"><font color="#000000"><span style="text-decoration: none;">www.tutorialspoint.com</span></font></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/" target="_blank"><font color="#000000"><span style="text-decoration: none;">www.javatpoint.com</span></font></a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.javased.com/" target="_blank"><font color="#000000"><span style="text-decoration: none;">www.javased.com</span></font></a></li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%;" align="left">This
blog will present observations and comments on the use of such tools as
well as their comparisons and evaluations. It will also present good
and bad practices in programming and project management and my thoughts
on what the consequences are. All in the spirit of Clean Code &amp;
Software Craftsmanship. <br />
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%;" align="left">Instead
of the path of magic and secret knowledge, I propose an engineering
approach in the spirit of the KISS and Clean Code principles. I believe
that although it is demanding, it is also developmental and allows you
to create code that does not become a huge ball of muddy pasta. <br />
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%;" align="left">However,
the main slogan of this blog is <span style="font-weight: bold;">USE YOUR HEAD - THE DEVELOPER'S MOST
IMPORTANT TOOL!</span><br />
</p>

<hr />
<p align="left">The blog itself works on my proprietary application and
will grow with it. Instead of presenting empty, out of context
examples, they will be implemented in this blog (application) and
presented for your evaluation in the form of a code review as well as
actual working solutions. </p>

<p align="left">Go agead and do a code review - whole projest is
published on <a href="https://github.com/BartoszBlaszczak/hexlog.dev" target="_blank"><font color="#000000"><span style="text-decoration: none;"><b>GitHub</b></span></font></a>.
</p>

<p align="left">This application is and will be developed
unconventionally and experimentally. It is not supposed to be another
standard project, but rather a litmus test of programming solutions.
Open your head by looking at its code. <br />
</p>

<p align="left">It is written in <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/" target="_blank"><font color="#000000"><span style="text-decoration: none;"><b>Kotlin</b></span></font></a>, which
is my favourite general purpose programming language. </p>

<p align="left">Behind each language is not only its architecture,
syntax and purpose, but also the environment and culture of its use. <br />
</p>

<p align="left">There is a philosophy behind Kotlin that I support not
only in programming. I mean brevity, comfort as well as readability and
pragmatism.&nbsp;<br />
</p>

<p align="left">A large part of this blog is devoted to the world of
Kotlin and the approach that this language proposes. <br />
